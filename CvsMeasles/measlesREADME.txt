"raw_data" contains the original measles data in an R workspace file and compressed file of csv-files. Because of changes in reporting boundaries in the late 1960's the data has two spatial configurations. 

The pre-vaccination data (1944 through 1964) are data for all 954 urban centers (cities and towns). 

BIRTHS:

- ewBu4464 is the annual number of births recorded for each of the 954 pre- urban areas

MEASLES:

- ewBu4464 are the weekly number of measles cases recorded for each of the 954 pre- urban areas

Note the length of the time series are not a multiple of 52 because every 4-5 years have 53 reporting periods

POPULATION:

- ewBu4464 is annual population size for each of the 954 pre- urban areas

COORDINATES:

- ewBu4464 are lat-long population size for each of the 954 pre- urban areas
