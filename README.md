A demonstration project to assess performance + fidelity of fixed-generation spatial transmission models using `numpy.array` cohorts, and to develop intuition quickly for system dynamicss with `panel` interactive web applications.

To explore interactive animation yourself in a browser, run the following Python commands:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

> panel serve interactive.ipynb --autoreload

Then navigate to served site at: http://localhost:5006/interactive
